MongoDB
MongoDB is a NoSQL database management system.
It stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents.
Ideal for applications with rapidly changing data models.

2: Functionalities of MongoDB
1. It supports ad-hoc queries.
2. It offers indexing for faster queries.
3. it is horizontal scalability through sharding.
4. it has a replication for high availability and fault tolerance.


SQL (Relational Databases)
SQL databases store data in tables with predefined schemas.
Suitable for applications with complex queries and transactions.

Functionalities of SQL
1. ACID compliance ensures data integrity.
2. Supports complex queries using SQL language.
3. Joins allow data from multiple tables to be combined.
4. Transactions ensure data consistency.

Here are the comparison between MongoDB and SQL

Data Model: MongoDB uses a flexible, schema-less document model, while SQL databases have a rigid, predefined schema.

Scalability: MongoDB offers horizontal scalability through sharding, whereas scaling SQL databases can be more complex.

Query Language: MongoDB uses a rich query language but lacks the complexity of SQL for advanced querying.

Transactions: SQL databases support ACID transactions, ensuring data consistency, which MongoDB lacks in its earlier versions.

Use Cases:MongoDB is suitable for applications requiring flexibility and scalability, while SQL is preferred for complex queries and transactions.
